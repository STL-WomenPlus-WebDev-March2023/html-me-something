       <h2>Looking back on a year of family travel. </h2>
       <p id=”intro”>It has been an unusual year of opportunities getting away together, both on our own and with extended family. We did some deeper exploration in the midwest, places we hadn't been before. But also as far out as the Bahamas. </p>

           <h2>Boston</h2>
           <img src="images/Travels__Boston.png">
           <p>I had a trip scheduled to a work conference in Portsmouth, NH. My husband and I decided to go up early and visit Boston. It was our first time traveling the in the NorthEast together. We loved Boston: the history, the beauty of the parks and the ocean. It was a perfect trip.<p>

               <h2>Maine and Acadia</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Maine.png">
           <p>After exploring Boston a few days, we went up through Maine and into Acadia. Maine is one of my new favorite states and I hope to get to spend more time there. The smalls, the lobster, the coast and the old brick buildings were gorgeous.<p>

               <h2>Bentonville Art Tour (Judah and Me)</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Bentonville with Judah.png">
           <p>Every every other year, I take one of the kids on a trip just them and me. In early fall of 2022, Judah and I took a trip to Bentonville for the first time. It was truly an adventure of food and art. We visited the Crystal Bridges Art Museum where they had an outdoor showing of the Labyrinth (complete with a David Bowie impersonator). Then ate our way through the ciy over the course of the long weekend, stopping by the many outdoor murals around town. I have not spent much time in Arkansas in general, but my son and I enjoyed our time so much that we decided to go back for Spring Break with the whole family.<p>

               <h2>Branson and Garth Brooks</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Branson.png">
           <p>This doesn't qualify as much of a trip, being a quick overnight for a concert. But we got a chance to see Garth Brooks at the brand new Thunder Ridge Arena outside of Branson. Missouri's natural beauty is so often overlooked for more exotic locations. But this venue overlooking the forested Ozark "Mountains" was breathtaking.<p>

               <h2>Chicago and Rosalia</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Chicago with Mal.png">
           <p>My sister and I took a train from St. Louis to Chicago for Rosalia's concert there. The weather was gorgeous in the fall and Rosalia put on an incredible performance. <p>

               <h2>Oklahoma Cattle Sale</h2>
               <img src="images/oklahoma.png">
           <p>My husband's family met up at our nephew's cattle sale in the fall in Oklahoma, giving us a good chance to get together as a family.<p>

               <h2>Bahamas Cruise</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Cruise1.png">
           <p>My husband and I turned 40 this winter. To celebrate, we took the kids on a cruise in the Bahamas. It was our first cruise as a family and we visited Nassau, Grand Turk and Half Moon Cay. I highly recommend escaping Missouri's gray January for a little tropical color infusion. <p>

               <h2>Hot Springs and Races</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels_HotSprings.png">
           <p>My husband's side of the family has begun to do Spring weekend getaways in the past couple of years. This year, we met at a halfway point (between Texas and Missouri) of Hot Springs, AR. We watched the races, and explored the town full of the history of "wellness travel" in the early 1900s. <p>


               <h2>Bentonville (Spring Break Family) </h2>
               <img src="images/Travels_Bentonvill-Spring-Break.png">
           <p>After the bigger trips in the fall and winter, we opted for a smaller, closer, and quieter escape over Spring Break. Since Judah and I had enjoyed Bentonville so much we found a cabin and headed back. This was by far our most relaxing trip of the year. Jason and I worked half-days during the day while the kids watched movies or played video games. Then we explored museums and both Rogers and Bentonville in the afternoons.<p>


               <h2>Minnesota with Ruby</h2>
               <img src="images/Travels__Minneapolis.png">
           <p>For my daughter's turn to travel, we went back to where she was born: Minneapolis. We moved back to St. Louis when she was around 18 months old and haven't had a chance to revisit. I love traveling one-on-one with my kids. It gives us a chance to spend time together, listen to music, be silly, eat great food and just enjoy life together outside of normal responsibilities. We kept busy, visiting the lakes, the sculpture garden, Matt's bar for the original Juicy Lucy, the Mall of America and so many other favorite places.<p>
